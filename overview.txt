Golf Course Auto Booking
- Enter in the golf course you want and the timeframe you want + how many people you want
    - Put in your credit card if its required
- Would automatically book a tee time at this time 
- Input a time frame and zip code and it will auto-book if no credit card required, either way will alert you
- Use case 1: scoop up cancellations 
    - an LLM agent to do this
    - Webcrawl and basically scroll on the page by itself and take in time data, convert time data into integer and compare to user-inputted time, if it matches then go ahead and click through to book the tee time
